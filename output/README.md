# Output Directory

#### This folder is solely used to store outputs.

For space constraints, the datasets and the high resolution images are not stored in GitHub.
If anyone is interested, it can be downloaded as a archive from the following links.

Click on[Dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By71xL1Nx_SfR0hTekFXSGJPckk) to download a sample dataset. This one is *172MB* in size.
If you want to test out on larger datasets, I would suggest to use to program to
generate a larger one on the local machine.

Click on[Images](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By71xL1Nx_Sfa1RvVjVsSWlFSTQ)
to download the high-resolution images of the output that are already provided. 
Similar to [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By71xL1Nx_SfR0hTekFXSGJPckk), if you wish to generate these images on the local machine, then use the program.
Keep in mind, that the correct dependencies for the python program to run are installed.
